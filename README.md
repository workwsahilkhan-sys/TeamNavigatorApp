# Team Navigator App\n\nA comprehensive mobile app for navigation, team coordination, and mission planning with full offline capabilities for hikers, adventurers, rescue teams, and defense personnel.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Topographic/Terrain Map**: Uses React Native Maps with terrain type; offline support via Mapbox (requires token).\n- **Real-time Location Sharing**: Internet (Socket.io), Bluetooth (BLE), LoRa mesh.\n- **Teammate Management**: Add with names, callsigns, groups; persistent storage.\n- **Waypoints**: Set and share across connectivity modes.\n- **Chat**: Multi-mode chat with Gifted Chat.\n- **Compass & Sensors**: Heading, elevation, coordinates.\n- **Offline Mode**: AsyncStorage for data; direct device comms.\n- **Hardware Integration**: LoRa via Meshtastic devices connected over Bluetooth.\n\n## Setup\n\n### Mobile App\n1. Install dependencies: `npm install`\n2. For Mapbox offline: Add `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` to app.json plugins.\n3. Run: `npm start`\n\n### Server (for Internet Mode)\n1. Install server deps: `npm install express socket.io cors`\n2. Run server: `npm run server` (listens on port 3000)\n3. Update socket URL in App.js to server IP.\n\n## Connectivity Options\n\n- **Internet**: Socket.io server for global sharing.\n- **Bluetooth/WiFi**: BLE PLX for nearby peer-to-peer.\n- **LoRa Mesh**: Long-range radio mesh using Meshtastic (BLE-connected devices).\n\n## Offline Support\n\n- Maps: Pre-download regions in Mapbox.\n- Data: AsyncStorage persists teammates, waypoints.\n- Comms: Bluetooth/LoRa work offline.\n\n## Hardware Integration\n\n- **LoRa**: Use SX1276-based devices with Meshtastic firmware. Pair via BLE in app. Protocols: LoRa modulation for 10-20km range.\n- **Radio**: Similar, connect radio modules via serial/Bluetooth.\n- Research: LoRaWAN for infrastructure, direct LoRa for ad-hoc.\n\n## Usage\n\n- Set connectivity in Settings.\n- Add teammates and waypoints.\n- Share locations automatically.\n- Chat in selected mode.\n- Offline: Switch to Bluetooth/LoRa.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- Permissions: Grant location, Bluetooth.\n- Maps: Ensure Mapbox token.\n- Server: Run locally or deploy.\n- Hardware: Firmware update devices.\n- Expo Limitations: For full BLE, may need bare workflow.\n\n## Technologies\n\n- React Native/Expo\n- React Native Maps\n- Socket.io\n- BLE PLX\n- AsyncStorage\n- Gifted Chat\n\n## Future\n\n- Full BLE chat implementation.\n- LoRa direct integration.\n- Mission planning UI.\n
