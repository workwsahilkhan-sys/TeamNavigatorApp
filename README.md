# Team Navigator App\n\nA mobile app for navigation, team coordination, and mission planning with offline capabilities for hikers, adventurers, rescue teams, and defense personnel.\n\n## Features\n\n- Topographic/terrain map with offline support (using Mapbox)\n- Real-time location sharing via Internet, Bluetooth, or LoRa mesh\n- Teammate management with callsigns, groups, and details\n- Waypoint setting and sharing\n- Chat functionality with multiple connectivity options\n- Compass, coordinates, heading, elevation display\n- Full offline mode\n- Hardware support for radio/LoRa devices\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Install dependencies: `npm install`\n2. For Mapbox, set up API key in app.json or environment.\n3. Start the app: `npm start`\n\n## Technologies\n\n- React Native with Expo\n- React Native Maps with Mapbox provider for terrain and offline tiles\n- Expo Location and Sensors for GPS and compass\n- Socket.io for internet-based chat and location sharing\n- React Native Bluetooth Serial and BLE PLX for Bluetooth connectivity\n- Gifted Chat for chat UI\n- React Navigation for screens\n\n## Connectivity Options\n\n- **Internet**: Uses Socket.io for real-time communication. Requires server (placeholder in code).\n- **Bluetooth/WiFi**: Uses BLE for nearby device communication.\n- **Radio/LoRa Mesh**: Integrates with LoRa devices like Meshtastic for long-range mesh networking.\n\n## Offline Support\n\n- Maps: Download Mapbox tiles for offline use.\n- Location: Cached when possible.\n- Chat/Sharing: Local storage and direct device communication.\n\n## Hardware Integration\n\nFor LoRa/radio support:\n- Connect LoRa modules (e.g., SX1276) via Bluetooth to the device.\n- Use protocols like Meshtastic for mesh networking.\n- Research: LoRaWAN for internet-connected, or direct LoRa for peer-to-peer.\n- In code, placeholders for hardware communication.\n\n## Usage\n\n- Grant location and Bluetooth permissions.\n- Add teammates and set waypoints on map.\n- Use chat for communication.\n- Switch connectivity modes in settings (placeholder).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- Location permissions required.\n- For offline maps, pre-download regions.\n- Hardware devices need proper pairing and firmware.\n- Internet mode requires stable connection.\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- Full mesh networking implementation.\n- Advanced terrain analysis.\n- Mission planning tools.\n","path">README.md
